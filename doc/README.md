# Hammer
Technology showcase application

## Project Goals

The Hammer project is a demonstration of how to build an application with
maximum productivity by controlling the scope.


## Rules of Hammer

* No features are created that are not needed.
* No features are created before tests.
* Functional tests start as a requirements doc and evolve into acceptance tests.
* Unit tests are implemented to collect all the development testing.
* All repeated tasks are automated.
* All small steps are committed to version control.
* An engineering log tracks the hours invested throughout the project.
* All development is done in small steps.
* Recipes are used to teach others how to repeat all the steps.
